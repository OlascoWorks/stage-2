> ## Request/Response Formats

- **Request Format**: All requests should be in JSON format. The content type of the request should be set to `application/json`.

- **Response Format**: Responses are returned in JSON format and include relevant information or error messages in a case of failure. Most successful responses include a `"message"` field for context.


> ## NOTE‚ÄºÔ∏è

- The API assumes that `"name"` is a unique identifier for persons.
- Validation is performed to ensure that `"name"` is a string value and `"id"` is an integer.
